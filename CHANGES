Revision history for Perl extension Data::Session.

1.06  Thu May 12 12:01:00 2011
	  - No code changes.

1.05  Tue Apr 12 13:11:00 2011
	- Eliminate references to /tmp by using File::Temp::newdir. This applies to docs and various scripts/*.pl.
	- Patch t/Test.pm to use DBI.
	- Patch t/basic.t to avoid a used once error on $BerkeleyDB::Error.
	- Add configure_requires => { 'Module::Build' => 0.38 } to Build.PL.
	- Reformat Build.PL and Makefile.PL now that we've reverted from Padre to Emacs (due to install issues).
	- Add META.json to files tracked by git.

1.04  Wed Feb 16 11:55:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.

	- Various small corrections to the POD.

1.01  Wed Dec  1 16:35:00 2010
	- In t/basic.t, use Module::Load to load BerkeleyDB and Cache::Memcache conditionally, and exit cleanly
