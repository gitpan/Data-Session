- Replace DBIx::Admin::DSNManager with Config::Tiny, to make it easier to put Data::Session into Debian.
- In Build.PL, shift DBIx::Admin::CreateTable from requires to build_requires. Config::Tiny goes there too.
- In the test code, change both sleeps from 2 to 3 seconds, to see if that solves rare test failures.
- In the test code, use File::Basename's fileparse rather than a regexp to see if the SQLite directory exists.
This should fix some test failures under Windows.

[V 1.10]
Date=2011-06-21T16:42:00
Comments= <<EOT
- After some marvellous debugging by Jeff Lavallee, one of the CPAN testers, I've changed O_RDONLY to O_RDWR in
Data::Session::Driver::File, to deal with a flock problem. This code was copied from CGI::Session, which may
therefore still have the same problem.
- Also, $! is now included in error messages, both in Data::Session::Driver::File and Data::Session::ID::AutoIncrement.
Because this reveals directories in paths, $! is only displayed when new(debug => 1) is used in Data::Session.

Comments= <<EOT
- Revert change in 1.08, which produces errors during global destruction.
This means, to save a session, you must store something in it, to force the session to be modified.
- Duplicate, briefly, the explanation of sessions and flushing, as the new first point in the FAQ.
- Changes some debug messages (relating to session and parameter expiry) which were ambiguous.

Comments=- Ensure new sessions, and not just modified ones, are written during flush().

[V 1.07]
Date=2011-05-16T09:23:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Remove redundant declaration of id() in Data::Session::ID::Static, which was producing the message:
field "id" redefined or overridden at ... line 10.
EOT

[V 1.06]
Date=2011-05-12T12:01:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Patch the tests to parse the DSN more closely, to skip tests if the SQLite directory /tmp does not exist.
This directory is present in t/basic.ini and t/bulk.ini.
EOT

[V 1.05]
Date=2011-04-12T13:11:00

- Eliminate references to /tmp by using File::Temp::newdir. This applies to docs and various scripts/*.pl.
- Patch t/Test.pm to use DBI.
- Patch t/basic.t to avoid a used once error on $BerkeleyDB::Error.
- Add configure_requires => { 'Module::Build' => 0.38 } to Build.PL.
- Reformat Build.PL and Makefile.PL now that we've reverted from Padre to Emacs (due to install issues).
- Add META.json to files tracked by git.

- Change the POD structure, so that all methods are assigned a level of head2 under a head1 of Methods.
- Various small corrections to the POD.
