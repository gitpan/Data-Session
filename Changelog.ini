[V 1.13]
Date=2012-05-03T11:23:00
Comments= <<EOT
- In parse_options(), the result of parsing the 'type' (driver:Pg;id:MD5;serialize:DataDumper)
was printed both for verbose == 1 and verbose > 1. Now it's only printed if verbose > 1.
- Apart from the above, no other code changes. Just additions to the docs, as follows...
- Add important section to the docs, under FAQ: Guidelines re Sources of Confusion.
(a) Firstly, explain (with examples) the difference (for CGI::Snapp-derived scripts) between:
$self -> param(a_key => 'a_value');
and
$self -> param('session') -> param(a_key => 'a_value');
(b) Explain at what stage in a CGI script flush() should be called.
(c) Then, explain (with examples) that:
$self -> param('session') -> param(a_hash => %a_hash);
will fail, and you must use a hashref:
$self -> param('session') -> param(a_hash => {%a_hash});
Likewise for arrays 'v' arrayrefs.

[V 1.12]
Date=2012-04-24T15:13:00
Comments= <<EOT
- After prompting by William Bulley (many thanx!) I found a range of issues which have been addressed:
- Some combinations of options to new() triggered an unjustifiable die, so code in validate_options()
has been simplified.
- Add new demos in scripts/: cgi.demo.cgi (CGI script), cgi.sha1.pl (command line script), and file.sha1.pl.
- Copy scripts/cgi.demo.cgi into the Synopsis, since such a self-contained CGI demo was lacking.
- Copy scripts/file.sha1.pl into the Synopsis, to go with scripts/file.autoincrement.pl. These demonstrate
the different uses of file_name and id_file as options to new().
- Clean up some typos within the other demo code in the Synopsis.
- Clean up similar typos in scripts/file.autoincrement.pl.
- Expand the discussion of how certain options to new() interact. See Combinations of Options.
- Fix various typos throughout the PODs.
- Switch from Module::Load to Class::Load.
- Change the versions of the pre-reqs to correspond to what was available with Perl V 5.10.1.

[V 1.11]
Date=2011-07-08T11:17:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace DBIx::Admin::DSNManager with Config::Tiny, to make it easier to put Data::Session into Debian.
- In Build.PL, shift DBIx::Admin::CreateTable from requires to build_requires. Config::Tiny goes there too.
- In the test code, change both sleeps from 2 to 3 seconds, to see if that solves rare test failures.
- In the test code, use File::Basename's fileparse rather than a regexp to see if the SQLite directory exists.
This should fix some test failures under Windows.

[V 1.10]
Date=2011-06-21T16:42:00
Comments= <<EOT
- After some marvellous debugging by Jeff Lavallee, one of the CPAN testers, I've changed O_RDONLY to O_RDWR in
Data::Session::Driver::File, to deal with a flock problem. This code was copied from CGI::Session, which may
therefore still have the same problem.
- Also, $! is now included in error messages, both in Data::Session::Driver::File and Data::Session::ID::AutoIncrement.
Because this reveals directories in paths, $! is only displayed when new(debug => 1) is used in Data::Session.

[V 1.09]
Date=2011-06-17T14:22:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Revert change in 1.08, which produces errors during global destruction.
This means, to save a session, you must store something in it, to force the session to be modified.
- Duplicate, briefly, the explanation of sessions and flushing, as the new first point in the FAQ.
- Changes some debug messages (relating to session and parameter expiry) which were ambiguous.
EOT

[V 1.08]
Date=2011-06-17T13:07:00
Comments=- Ensure new sessions, and not just modified ones, are written during flush().

[V 1.07]
Date=2011-05-16T09:23:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Remove redundant declaration of id() in Data::Session::ID::Static, which was producing the message:
field "id" redefined or overridden at ... line 10.
EOT

[V 1.06]
Date=2011-05-12T12:01:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Patch the tests to parse the DSN more closely, to skip tests if the SQLite directory /tmp does not exist.
This directory is present in t/basic.ini and t/bulk.ini.
EOT

[V 1.05]
Date=2011-04-12T13:11:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Eliminate references to /tmp by using File::Temp::newdir. This applies to docs and various scripts/*.pl.
- Patch t/Test.pm to use DBI.
- Patch t/basic.t to avoid a used once error on $BerkeleyDB::Error.
- Add configure_requires => { 'Module::Build' => 0.38 } to Build.PL.
- Reformat Build.PL and Makefile.PL now that we've reverted from Padre to Emacs (due to install issues).
- Add META.json to files tracked by git.

[V 1.04]
Date=2011-02-16T11:55:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.

Comments= <<EOT
- Add DBD::SQLite to the list of pre-reqs.
- Patch POD warning users to avoid Storable due to this bug:

[V 1.02]
Date=2010-12-14T11:16:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change handling of parameters passed to cookie(), so that the caller may pass extra parameters to
the query object's cookie() method.
- Document the $atime parameter to the atime() method.
- Change the POD structure, so that all methods are assigned a level of head2 under a head1 of Methods.
- Various small corrections to the POD.

[V 1.01]
Date=2010-12-01T16:35:00
Comments= <<EOT
- In t/basic.t, use Module::Load to load BerkeleyDB and Cache::Memcache conditionally, and exit cleanly
if they are not installed.

Comments=- Original version.
